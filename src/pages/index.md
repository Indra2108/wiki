# Hi there! I'm Damar.

I am a Software Developer who specializes in Mobile Development based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

I wrote my first line of code when I was still in vocational high school. I learned to write Batch Scripts in Windows.

Currently, I'm studying and mentoring at Pesantren IT, an informal education in Yogyakarta that focuses on IT skill development and Islamic education. There, I am entrusted to be a React Native Mentor, responsible for guiding santri in building mobile applications, specifically for Android.

Besides coding, another thing I enjoy is writing. I love jotting down my thoughts and ideas in physical journals, like books, or digital platforms such as knowledge bases or blogs. Check out my blog site [here](https://indra.hashnode.dev).
